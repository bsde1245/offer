**Airtel Broadband: Know More About?**

Airtel Broadband simple answer is “it depends”. Typically speeds start at about 512 Kbps and go up to 16 Mbps for most home users. Some installations may go as fast as 100Mbps or more depending primarily on the equipment used, distances involved, cabling quality, encoding techniques, and frequency spectrum available and even to some degree, end system configurations. Be aware that some DSL is sold as asymmetric or “rate-adaptive”. It is best to consult the providers in your area as to the access rates available in your area. Speeds can vary from provider to provider even if they are all servicing your area from the same central office
