Jio is again back  with some great functions and offers and I  will tell you all about it in my post Jio DTH Online Booking Registration. But this time it will be Jio DTH services. As we have to pay a lot for Tv recharge and their services. Also Set top box price is high of every company. So Jio will be having a lot cheaper price than other companies.

As Jio is using internet facility, so it is going to be a whole new experience for users. You can watch Tv online without any buffering. Also, they are having very different plans for each type of users. Some plans are also around Rs 60-100. You can have a plan according to your choice and start enjoying your DTH services by Jio.
