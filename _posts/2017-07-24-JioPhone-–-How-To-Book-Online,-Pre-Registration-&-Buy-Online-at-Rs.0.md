JioPhone specifications leaked before the launch included dual SIM functionality, 2-megapixel rear camera, VGA front camera, FM radio, and Bluetooth connectivity. The JioPhone has also been tipped to come with a 4GB of internal storage, and 512MB of RAM. The Jio Phone is a dual SIM (GSM and GSM) mobile that accepts Micro-SIM and Regular. Connectivity options include Hotspot, Bluetooth, NFC, Headphones, FM and 4G (with support for Band 40 used by some LTE networks in India).

Users can either pay Rs 153 per month, for which they will get free voice and SMS, and unlimited data (high-speed data FUP is 500MB per day), along with Jio apps. They can also choose to pay Rs. 309 per month to get all this, plus the support for mirroring your screen on a TV, via a cable that can even be plugged into CRT TVs. After three years, you can return the phone, and get a full refund on the deposit. Aside from that, the company will also have two sachet packs, at Rs 24 for two days, or Rs 54 per week, for users who don’t want to commit to Rs 153 as an upfront payment.

“There are 78 crore mobile phones in India,” Mukesh Ambani pointed out. “However, in this 78 crore, there are more than 50 crore feature phone users, who have been left out. They can neither afford the cheapest LTE smartphone, nor the exorbitant cost of data.” Jio 1500 rs phone

“Data is the oxygen of digital life, and no Indian should suffer because of unaffordability,” he added. “Sadly the vast majority of mobile users are starved of data. This unfairness must end, and Jio is committing to ending it today.” Jio rs 1500 phone

To accomplish this, the company needs to deliver on three pillars, Ambani said – connectivity, data affordability, and device affordability. “Jio is a data strong network built for the Internet from the ground up,” he said. “The TRAI speedtest portal has consistently ranked Jio as the clear 4G network leader in coverage, usage, and data speeds.”

“Our network continues to rapidly expand. Jio, in the next 12 months, will cover 99 percent of the population. India’s 4G coverage will be more than its 2G coverage,” he added. To meet the need for device affordability, the company realised it would have to release a 4G VoLTE feature phone, as even an entry level smartphone costs between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,500, Ambani said.
